# Nadav Finteka Mission

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## Features

- registeration
- login
- getUser
- updateFirstName

## To use postman

import finteka.postman_collection.json

Each folder represents a lambda function

Steps:
run registeration
run login
After login copy the token paste it in Authorization section
select type: Bearer Token and paste the token
run getUser
run updateFirstName

To run locally you should configure aws-credentials and the code after importing AWS

```javascript
import AWS from "aws-sdk";
const directoryPath = process.cwd();
AWS.config.loadFromPath(`${directoryPath}\\aws-credentials.json`);
```

## Improvements

make ci/cd pipeline from github to s3 and redploy lambda functions
